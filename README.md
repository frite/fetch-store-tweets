## Synopsis

This script will fetch the Tweets of a given user and store them in the database. It will store only the Tweets, **that is the text, no metadata**.

Regarding the config file. Do not wrap your tokens around quotes etc. They are not needed.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
And finally, some [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSnCKhRGu3w).

## Why?

I'm lazy, unless you want to go through all tweets one by one. I'm ok with that.

## What about PRs?

Sure. Make one.

## Tests?

Yeah. Not on this one.
